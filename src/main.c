 * • Each philosopher must be represented as a separate thread.
 * • There is one fork between each pair of philosophers.
 * Therefore, if there are several philosophers, 
 * each philosopher has a fork on their left side and a fork on their right side.
 * If there is only one philosopher, they will have access to just one fork.
 * • To prevent philosophers from duplicating forks, you should protect each fork’s state
